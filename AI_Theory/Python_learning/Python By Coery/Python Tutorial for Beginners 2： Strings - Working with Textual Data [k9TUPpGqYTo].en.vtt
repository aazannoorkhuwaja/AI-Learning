00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.070
Hey there. How's it going everybody in this video?

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.890
We'll be learning about python Data types and specifically

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.380
We'll be learning about how to work with textual data and textual data in python are represented with strings

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.450
So we currently have [opened] our intro pi file that we were working with in the last video

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.909
Where we just printed out hello world and I'll go ahead and run this so that we can see that down here

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.039
It does print out hello [world] [now]

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.709
This line here is using the print function

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.689
and we're passing this text value into that print function now if we wanted to create a

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.499
Variable that holds that text value then we could say now

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.540
I'll just get rid of this comment for now

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.770
So if I wanted a variable to hold that value then I can just create a variable and we'll call that

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:46.769
message and we'll set that message variable equal to our text value that we passed in to print and

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.410
Here message is our variable [name]

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.329
so if you're coming from another [language]

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.479
Then you might be wondering if we need [to] use semicolons or something like that to end each line but python doesn't need that it

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.219
operates on Whitespace alone

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.649
Which makes it a very clean language to work with?

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:09.209
Now by convention our variables are usually all lowercase and if it's multiple words then we separate those with underscore

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.909
So if instead my variable name was my message, then it would be my underscore message

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.819
So that's just a convention that's commonly used and also these variable names should be as descriptive as possible

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.779
As to what values they're meant to hold so message is a good variable name here because it's holding our message

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.670
But if I was instead to call this variable m which is a valid variable name

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.499
But anyone reading my code now wouldn't know when they see this in variable

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.360
What value it's supposed to hold so message is a much better variable name in this case

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.059
So this message variable now holds our text data and our text data is called a string now

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.670
We can use our variable in place of this string

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.589
Anywhere that we use it in our program, so instead [of] printing out hello world

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.679
Directly here. I'm instead going to now print out this variable and that should give us the same results

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.790
So if I run that then you can see down here, we still get [the] same result now

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.390
We can see that

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.500
I created this string with single quotes now you can also use double quotes

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.509
so if you're wondering if there is a difference between the single quotes in the double quotes

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.140
And it really just depends on what text you have in your string

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.069
So for example if you have a single quote in your string

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:28.699
So for example let's create one with a single quote instead of hello world, [I] will instead make our string

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.420
Bobby's World

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.420
Now see the problem [here] is that?

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:40.430
Python sees this single quote within our text as being the end of the string and it's not going to know what to do

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.609
With what comes after that single quote here because it thinks that's where the string is closing

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.309
So if you run this now then you'll get an error now

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.429
There's a couple of different ways to [handle] this we could escape this single quote with a backslash

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.369
so if I escape that single quote and now

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.480
Run this now python knows that this single quote doesn't close out the string and that instead this one should

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.899
Now another way to handle that is [to] instead

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.950
So I'll take away that xscape character now another way to handle that is instead

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.019
Just use double quotes on the outside of our string any string [that] contains single quotes

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.989
So if we know that our string contains a single quote then we can instead use double quotes on the outside

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:30.078
And then it'll know that that single quote isn't the end of the string so now if we run this then we can see that

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:30.900
It still works fine

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.730
But that doesn't necessarily mean that double quotes are better because it goes both ways if your string contains double quotes in the message then

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.929
I would use single quotes on the outside now if we needed to create a

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.500
multi-line string and one way we can do this is by using three quotes at the beginning and end of our string and

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.310
these can also be

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.690
Single or double quotes as [well], so let's go ahead and look at an example

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.668
So I'll add three quotes to the beginning and end of our string here

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.689
And now I'll just add [some] text to spans multiple Lines here

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:09.139
so I'll just say was a good and then hit enter to go to a new line and say cartoon in the

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:17.419
1990s so now if we run [that] and we can see that it printed out [our] string correctly over multiple lines, [okay]?

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.198
So let's go back to our simple hello world example

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.699
So I'm just going to take all of that and replace it with our previous

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.509
Hello world example, and now let's go ahead and just run that really quick

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.700
So we're back to our starting point so we can think of our string as a string of individual characters

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:41.779
And we can access these individual characters also, so first let's see how we can find how many characters are in our string

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.160
So to do this we can use the [len] function which stands for length

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.430
So whenever I print out here if I was instead of printing my message if I was to print out this

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.459
Length function and pass in message, and then run this. Now we're no longer printing out our message

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.889
We're printing out the length of our message

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.669
And we can see that it says that the length of our string is 11

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:10.009
And if we counted these up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:17.719
Then we can see that that's correct, and we can access our strings characters individually, so to do this we can use the square

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:25.099
Brackets after our string and pass in the location of the character that we want. So, I'll say print

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:31.429
Message and then square brackets now the location is called an index and it starts out at 0

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.509
So to access the first character of our string we can say

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:43.610
print the message and then access this index of 0 so if we print that then we can see that we got the

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.300
capital H now

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:52.879
since the length of our string is 11 that means that with the first character starting out at 0 our last character would be at

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:59.090
Index 10 so it's our total length minus 1 so if I was to say print out the

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:05.720
Location at Index 10 the value at Index 10 then we can see that we got our d character

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.720
Which is the last character in that string.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:13.669
Now if you accidentally try to access an index that doesn't exist then you'll get an index error. So if we were to say

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.970
Access the index of 11, and we can see that that through an index error now

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.160
We can also access a range of characters

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:28.880
So if I just wanted to get the word hello from our string then we could say that we want

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.320
0 and then this colon 5 and we'll explain this

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:39.950
So the first index here is our starting point and the second in that index which is separated by this colon is

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.379
The stopping point now one thing a little confusing about this is that the first index is

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.990
Inclusive which means it's going to include that value, but the second index is not now

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.100
There's good reasons for this

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:57.379
But it's still easy to forget so basically what we're saying is I want all the characters

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.809
Between the beginning and up to but not including the fifth index

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:08.269
And it will be more clear if we just go ahead and run this so we can see that it prints out. Hello

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:14.270
So it printed out our message from the zero index here all the way up to but not including

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:21.169
The [5th] Index here, so we got hello now since our starting point. Here is just [the] first index

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.699
We can actually just leave that off and it will assume that we want to start at the beginning

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:31.460
So if we don't put anything there and then : [five] then we should get the same thing

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.710
So if we run [that] we can see we still got hello

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:39.919
now instead if we wanted to grab the word world from the string then we could start at

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:46.430
The sixth Index and then we can just go to the end and just like leaving off our

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.829
Starting index it will start from the beginning

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.400
Leaving off the stop index just goes all the way to the end

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:58.130
So now if we run that and we can see that it gives us back the word world now what we're doing

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.070
Here is called slicing and if you'd like to learn more about

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:07.039
Slicing in depth then you can watch my detailed video on that and I'll leave a link to [that] in the [description] section below

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:12.800
So now let's just go back to printing out our message and let me run this okay

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:18.740
So all of the data types that we're going to review are going to have certain methods available to us that give us access to

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:25.939
a lot of useful functionality now when I say methods a lot of people wonder what's the difference between a method and a function and

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:29.209
functions and methods are basically the same thing [a]

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.329
Method is just a function that belongs to an object

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.790
It's not important to get into the details of that now

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:40.460
But if you hear me say method or function then you can basically think of those as the same thing for now

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:45.199
So like I was saying the data types that we'll be going over all have certain methods

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:51.920
Available to us that give us access to a lot of useful functionality so let's look at some of these string methods

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:55.300
So we can see here that our hello world text is

00:08:56.030 --> 00:09:01.089
Capitalized, but let's say [that] we wanted that to be all lowercase now to do this

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:08.379
It's just as easy as saying print message and then to lowercase this we can say dot lower

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:15.249
Now when we run this dot lower with these parentheses here. That's running the lower method on the string

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:21.520
So when we ran that we can see that now our hello world has been set to all lowercase [and] [if] we wanted to do

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.490
this to uppercase and it's as easy as changing at

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:28.059
Lower to upper if we run that now we can see that

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.750
Hello
World is all uppercase?

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:34.300
So now let's say that we want to count a certain number of characters in our string and to do that

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:40.509
We can use the count method and the count method actually takes a string as an argument so we can say

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:45.129
Message dot count and now we have to pass in an argument

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:48.249
And it has to know what we want to count in our message

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:49.270
So what for now?

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.710
We'll [just] say count hello

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:56.259
And if we run that we can see that it returns that the string hello appears in our message one time

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:00.579
But if we instead just passed in a single character as argument

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.770
So I'll pass in an L if I run that

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:07.810
You can see that we get a 3 because there are three L's and our message variable

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:14.469
So if we instead want to find the index of where certain characters can be found and we can use the find method so I?

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:20.290
Could come up here instead of saying dot count I can say not fine and now this takes an argument as well

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:25.029
It's what we want to find so let me type in world here and run this

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.330
And we can see when [we] run this that it returns a six

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:34.449
and that's because world starts at the sixth index of our message variable now if we try to

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:39.279
Find a string of characters that doesn't exist then it will just return negative one

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.780
so if instead of world

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:48.100
I typed in universe and ran that you can see it returns a negative one because it can't find that anywhere in our message variable

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:53.110
Okay, so now let's say that we want to replace some characters in our string with some other characters

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:59.469
And we can do this with the replace method now first. I'm going to change this change this back to printing out our

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:01.270
regular message

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:03.270
[so] I'll just delete these

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:10.539
Now let's try to use our replace method right below where we first set our message fair herbal and this method takes two arguments

00:11:11.029 --> 00:11:15.369
First it takes what we want to replace so first let me just say message

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:21.130
But replace so first it takes what we want to replace, so let's say that we want to replace

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.670
world and now the second argument

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:31.510
Which is separated by a comma [is] what we want to replace world with so we'll replace world with universe

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:38.140
So now if [we] run this and this might be a little unexpected we can see that it's still printing out hello world

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:44.169
[now] the reason our replacement didn't work is because it's not making that replacement in place

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:51.010
It's actually returning a new string with those values replaced and we'll learn more about return statements when we learn about

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.879
Functions, but basically we need to set a new variable here

00:11:55.459 --> 00:12:02.409
To get that returned string with those replacements, so I could say something like new message is

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:04.339
equal to

00:12:04.339 --> 00:12:07.449
That original method with this replacement

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:09.730
So now if we set that

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:16.329
New variable and instead print that new message and run that and you can see that now it replaced the world with

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:16.930
universe

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.209
and if you really wanted to make the

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:26.349
Replacement to the message variable then instead of making a new message variable and we can just set this same message

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:33.010
Variable again, so now we're setting the same message variable equal to that replacement and then printing it out

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:37.089
So if I run that and we can see that now the message variable had world

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:43.359
Replaced with universe and this may look a little strange [to] set a variable to an altered [version] of itself

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.760
But it's very common, and you'll be using that a lot

00:12:46.279 --> 00:12:50.198
Okay, so now let's get rid of this replace line here

00:12:50.199 --> 00:12:56.649
And now let's look at how we can add multiple strings and concatenate them together, so instead of saying hello world

00:12:56.649 --> 00:12:59.979
I'm instead just going to set this equal to hello and

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:06.399
Instead of calling this message. I'm going to set this equal to greeting and just below greeting

00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:11.379
I'm going to create a variable called name and I'm going [to] set that equal to we'll just say

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:16.180
Michael and now lastly let's create a message here and

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:21.130
We want this message to combine our greeting with our name

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:27.100
Wanted to say hello Michael and one way to do this is to use the plus sign operator

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:27.920
so

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:34.839
We could try this by saying greeting plus name now if we run this and we can see that

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:40.149
It's not exactly what we wanted it combined them together, but it doesn't have a space there

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:44.709
So when you're concatenated strings together it's easy to make mistakes like this

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:52.179
So what we want to do is add a string between them so that spaces them out so we can add a string between these

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:55.660
Just by putting in a string literal here

00:13:55.660 --> 00:14:02.529
And I'm also going to put in a comma and a space to separate those and now we also need another plus sign

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:08.470
So that we're adding the name after that string so now we're saying that we want this greeting. Which is hello

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:13.929
plus this comma and space plus the name so if I run this

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.929
Then we can see that it concatenated those strings together

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:23.500
How we wanted now sometimes using the plus sign isn't the best way to go if we wanted to create a longer more?

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:28.570
Complicated string while using our variables and adding them all together like this

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:33.339
Might get hard to keep track [of] so let's say that we wanted to add to the end of our message

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:36.939
Just by you know closing off a sentence and saying

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:39.970
Welcome so to do that after our name variable

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:46.209
we could add another string that is a period to close off that sentence a space and then

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:51.759
Welcome with an exclamation point so let's go ahead and run that now we can see that it printed out the string

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.030
How we wanted it to look?

00:14:53.030 --> 00:15:00.699
But it's starting to get a little complicated on this line here to keep track of all of our plus signs and spaces within our

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.700
message

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.290
instead with strings like this

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:05.739
It's usually better to use a formatted string

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:12.040
[this] allows [us] to write the sentence as it will appear and put placeholders in place of our variables

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:16.719
So let's go ahead and see what this would look like so though instead use a formatted string

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:22.449
We can say message is equal to and we're just going to write it exactly how it appears

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.790
Except everywhere where we want to

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:30.670
Replace with a variable we're going to put in a placeholder and those placeholders are going to be these curly brackets

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:38.650
so we want a placeholder for the greeting and then a comma a space and a placeholder for the name [and] a period and then

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:45.700
[we'll] type out welcome and an exclamation point and now to fill those placeholders with our variables

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.480
We can say dot

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:47.980
format

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:53.920
And pass in greeting for the first placeholder and [then] name for the second place holder

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:58.750
So now let's go ahead and delete this line where we where we were using the plus sign

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.990
Operator so if we run this we can see that

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:07.150
We got the same [thing] as when we concatenate and then together but with longer more complicated strings

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:10.900
This is actually a little bit easier to read it might look a little confusing now

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:16.510
Since we're just seeing these placeholders for the first time but after you get used to this you will realize that this is

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:22.419
Easier than keeping track [of] all those concatenations and using [stream] formatting like this also gives us some extra

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:28.150
Functionality and if you want to see everything [that] you can do with that and I do have a detailed in-depth video on string

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.670
Formatting and I'll add that to the description section below

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.520
Ok and lastly if you're using python

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:40.360
3.6 or above then you'll have access to these new things called f strings now if you aren't using

00:16:41.089 --> 00:16:44.679
[3.6] or higher then these aren't going to work because they were only

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:48.759
Recently released and not a lot of people are using these f strings yet

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.760
But I'm really liking them so far

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:55.839
Basically the idea behind f strings was to make string formatting as simple as possible

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.969
So let's go ahead and see what these look like so to say that [we] want this to [be] an f string

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:06.369
We can just add an f right here to the beginning on the outside of the string

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:12.698
now instead of using this dot format method well instead just write the variables directly within the

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:17.529
placeholders so [I] can remove that dot format method and now we can pass the

00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:20.469
variables directly within the placeholder

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:21.140
So we'll pass

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.130
Greeting to that

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:27.760
Placeholder and name to that one so I can save that and run it and you can see that using that we got the same

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:34.209
Result [and] like I said these f strings are pretty new to the language so even people who are very familiar with python

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:37.359
May be seeing this for the first time now one reason

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:42.189
I really like these f strings is because you can actually write code within the placeholder

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:47.830
So if I wanted the name and all caps for some reason then I could just come [into] the placeholder [here]

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:53.589
And say name dot upper and run that directly within the placeholder if I run that

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.730
Then you can see that now our name was capitalized, okay?

00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:58.930
So we're almost finished up

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:03.009
But I wanted to show you one last trick here when you're learning something new in python

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:08.589
So [we] saw a lot [of] different methods that we could use on our strings now if we ever wanted to see everything

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:14.079
That's available to us then there are a couple of things that we can do so first we can use this

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.680
dir function and that looks like this and

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.829
what this does is if we pass in A

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:28.330
Variable then it will show us all of the attributes and methods that we have access [to] with [that] variable now

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:33.430
Don't worry about all of these double underscore methods yet, but if we look down here

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:37.449
Then we'll see a couple of familiar methods that we used in this video

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:41.829
[so] for example we have dot upper here we have

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:44.420
not replace

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:45.800
dot lower

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:51.639
So this kind of gives you a broad overview of all the attributes and methods that are [available] to you now

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:57.459
This doesn't show what any of these actually do so to see more information about these string methods

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.680
Then we can use the help function

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:07.869
But if we run this help function on the name then that won't work we actually need to run it on the string class

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:11.199
Itself so we'll just type in help and then

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:17.020
Str for string and if I run that and we can see that this gives us a lot more [information]

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:19.020
And I'll pull this up here a bit

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:20.660
so it

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:25.660
You know tells us everything that's available to us, and if I scroll down here [a] bit

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:30.759
And if I try to find something that we actually used in this video okay, so we have fine here

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:36.699
So you can see that actually gives us a description of what these methods do and what arguments they take

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:40.660
Now if you know that you had a certain method available to you

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:47.410
But you couldn't remember exactly what it does then you can actually pass it directly in to help also, so if I wanted to

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:54.159
Find out some more information about the lower method then we could say string dot

00:19:54.440 --> 00:20:01.330
Lower and if we run that and we can see that it gives us information and the description just of what lower does

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.550
so using that dir function

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:09.190
and that help function is a great way to get a broad overview of the methods and attributes that [are] available to you and

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:13.450
Also, what using the help function gives you an idea of what those?

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:19.299
Methods do without actually you know going online and checking everything there, okay?

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.830
So I think that is going to do it for this video

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.830
I hope that now you feel comfortable with

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:27.729
Working with strings and are familiar [with] some of the useful things that we can do with those in the next video

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:32.890
We're learning how to work with numbers in python and specifically integers and floats

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.709
